# SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Music Store Sales

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL on a music store database, analyzing various business insights from customer transactions, employee data, invoices, and track details. The analysis includes:

1. Identifying the senior-most employee based on job title.
2. Finding countries with the highest number of invoices.
3. Extracting top-selling invoices and best-selling cities.
4. Identifying the best customers based on total spending.
5. Analyzing rock music listeners and finding the most influential rock bands.
6. Comparing track lengths to find songs longer than average.
7. Identifying top-selling artists and their customer base.
8. Discovering the most popular music genre in each country.
9. Finding high-spending customers from each country.

The project uses advanced SQL techniques, including JOINs, aggregate functions, CTEs, subqueries, window functions (DENSE_RANK), and ordering, to extract meaningful insights. This analysis can help businesses understand their top customers, best-selling artists, and key market trends.
